# About 
This bot opens full potential of HTML5 video embeds, it makes an HTTP request to the tiktok API and sends it directly to your discord chat!

If it detects any shared Tiktok URL on your discord server, the sent message is going to be deleted and replaced with video embed as soon as possible.
